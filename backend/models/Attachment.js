/*
    Sequelize only needs Model.belongsTo. The reason we've defined it inside of a method
    is because we can call this method after all models have been loaded in the code. If we put
    this code outside of a method, Sequelize tries to create the association as it's invoking the code,
    leading to circular reference issues where

    Model A tries to import B
    Model B tries to import A

    even though neither have been fully defined in the code.

    The name .associate is random, it could be anything. It's just a method we call.
